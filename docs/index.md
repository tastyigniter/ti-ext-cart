## Usage

### Adding items to the cart

You can add items to the cart using the `add` method on the `Igniter\Cart\Facades\Cart` facade.

Here's an example of **adding a single item** to the cart using an array of item details:

```php
use Igniter\Cart\Facades\Cart;

$quantity = 2;

$cartItem = Cart::add([
    'id' => 1,
    'name' => 'Cheeseburger',
    'price' => 10.00,
    'comment' => 'Extra ketchup',
], $quantity);
```

You can also add an item to the cart using the `Igniter\Cart\Models\Menu` model. The model must implement the `Igniter\Cart\Contracts\Buyable` interface.

```php
use Igniter\Cart\Facades\Cart;
use Igniter\Cart\Models\Menu;

$menuItem = Menu::find(1);

Cart::add($menuItem, $quantity, $options, $comment);
```

If you have **items with options**, you can pass the options as an array:

```php
$options = [
    'id' => 1, // Option ID
    'name' => 'Topping', // Option name
    'type' => 'checkbox', // Option type (select, radio, checkbox, quantity)
    'values' => [ // Selected option value
        [
            'id' => 1, // Option value ID
            'qty' => 1, // Option value quantity
            'price' => 1.00, // Option value price
            'name' => 'Peperoni', // Option value name
        ],
        [
            'id' => 1, // Option value ID
            'qty' => 1, // Option value quantity
            'price' => 1.99, // Option value price
            'name' => 'Sweetcorn', // Option value name
        ],
    ],
];

Cart::add($menuItem, $quantity, $options);
```

The `add` method returns the `CartItem` instance that was added to the cart.

You can also **add multiple items** to the cart using the `addItems` method:

```php
use Igniter\Cart\Facades\Cart;

$items = [
    [
        'id' => 1,
        'name' => 'Cheeseburger',
        'price' => 10.00,
    ],
    [
        'id' => 2,
        'name' => 'Fries',
        'price' => 5.00,
    ],
];

Cart::add($items);

Cart::add([$menuItem1, $menuItem2]);
```

### Updating items in the cart

You can update items in the cart using the `update` method on the `Cart` facade. The method accepts the cart item `rowId` as the first parameter.

If you want to update the quantity of an item in the cart, you can pass the new quantity as the second parameter:

```php
$rowId = '897162dd25db7f66e5fce4416b1884f3';

Cart::update($rowId, 4);
```

If you want to update the options of an item in the cart, you can pass the new options as the second parameter:

Cart::update($rowId, ['options' => $options]);
```

If you want to update the comment of an item in the cart, you can pass the new comment as the second parameter:

```php
$rowId = '897162dd25db7f66e5fce4416b1884f3';

Cart::update($rowId, ['comment' => 'Extra ketchup']);
```

You can also pass the `Igniter\Cart\Models\Menu` model instance as the second parameter to update the item in the cart:

```php
use Igniter\Cart\Facades\Cart;

```php
use Igniter\Cart\Facades\Cart;

$subtotal = Cart::subtotal();
```

You can retrieve the total of all items in the cart including any conditions using the `total` method on the `Cart` facade:

```php
use Igniter\Cart\Facades\Cart;

$total = Cart::total();
```

You can retrieve all applied conditions on the cart using the `conditions` method on the `Cart` facade:

```php

### Checkout

#### Placing an order

You can create an order from the cart using the `Igniter\Cart\Classes\OrderManager` class. The class provides methods to create an order from the cart and process the payment.

```php
use Igniter\Cart\Classes\OrderManager;
use Igniter\Local\Facades\Location;
use Igniter\Local\Models\Location as LocationModel;

$orderManager = resolve(OrderManager::class);

// Create a new order model instance, or retrieve an existing 
// order model instance if there is an order ID in the session
$order = $orderManager->loadOrder();

// Update location order type using the Location facade
Location::updateOrderType(LocationModel::COLLECTION);

// Update location schedule time slot to be used as order time
Location::updateScheduleTimeSlot($dateTime, $isAsap);

// Save the order attributes, order menu items, and order totals to the database
$orderManager->saveOrder($order, $attributes);
```

The `saveOrder` method saves the order attributes, order menu items, and order totals to the database.

The `$attributes` array may contain the following keys:

- `first_name`: _(string)_ The customer's first name.
- `last_name`: _(string)_ The customer's last name.
- `email`: _(string)_ The customer's email address. This is field is only required if the customer is a guest.

- `delivery_comment`: _(string)_ The order delivery comment.

#### Generating schedule time slots

You can generate schedule time slots for a location using the `scheduleTimeslot` method on the `Location` facade. The method accepts the `$orderType` parameter and returns a collection of timeslots where the key is the date string and value is an array of timeslots.

```php
$orderType = Location::COLLECTION;

$timeslots = Location::scheduleTimeslot($orderType);
```

For more information on generating schedule time slots, see the [Local Extension](https://tastyigniter.com/marketplace/item/igniter-local#working-hours) documentation.

#### Payment processing

Once the order has been created, you can process the payment for the order using the `processPayment` method on the `Igniter\Cart\Classes\OrderManager` class. The method accepts the order model instance and an array of order attributes as parameters.

```php
$orderManager->processPayment($order, $attributes);
```

For more information on processing payments, see the [PayRegister Extension](https://tastyigniter.com/marketplace/item/igniter-payregister#processing-checkout-payment-from) documentation.

#### Completing checkout

After creating an order and processing the payment, you can complete the checkout process by updating the order status, marking the order as paid and sending the order confirmation email to the customer.

```php
$order->updateOrderStatus($statusId);

$order->markAsPaymentProcessed();

$order->mailSend('igniter.cart::mail.order', 'customer');
```

#### Updating order status

You can update the order status using the `updateOrderStatus` method on the order model instance. The method accepts the order status ID or status model instance as the first parameter.

```php
$order->updateOrderStatus($statusId);
```

#### Assigning staff members

You can assign staff members to an order using the `assignTo` method on the order model instance. The method accepts an instance of the `Igniter\User\Models\UserGroup` model as the first parameter and the `Igniter\User\Models\User` model as the second parameter.

```php
use Igniter\User\Models\User;
use Igniter\User\Models\UserGroup;

$staff = User::find(1);
$group = UserGroup::find(1);

$order->updateAssignTo($group, $staff);
```

#### Cancelling an order

You can cancel an order using the `markAsCanceled` method on the order model instance. The method updates the order status to canceled order status configured in the admin area. The method accepts the `$statusData` array as the first parameter.

```php
$order->markAsCanceled($statusData);
```

The `$statusData` array may contain the following keys:

- `staff_id`: The staff ID who canceled the order.

| `igniter.cart.orderAssigned` |   After an order is assigned to a staff member.    |      The `Order` model instance and `User` model instance      |

Here is an example of hooking an event in the `boot` method of an extension class:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Event;

public function boot()
{
    Event::listen('igniter.checkout.beforeSaveOrder', function ($order, $data) {
        // ...
    });
}
```

### Order types

#### Defining order types

Order types are defined as classes that extends the `Igniter\Cart\Classes\AbstractOrderType` class and is typically stored in the `src/OrderTypes` directory of your extension. Here's an example of a delivery order type:

```php
namespace Author\Extension\OrderTypes;

use Igniter\Cart\Classes\AbstractOrderType;

class Delivery extends AbstractOrderType
{
    public function getOpenDescription(): string
    {
        return 'Delivery in 15 mins';
    }

    public function getOpeningDescription(string $format): string
    {
        return 'Delivery starts in 10 mins';
    }

    public function getClosedDescription(): string
    {
        return 'Delivery is closed';
    }

    public function getDisabledDescription(): string
    {
        return 'Delivery is not available.';
    }

    public function isActive(): bool
    {
        return $this->code === 'delivery';
    }

    public function isDisabled(): bool
    {
        return false;
    }
}
```

#### Registering order types

Once you have defined an order type class, you need to register the order types. Here's an example of registering a delivery order type:

```php
public function registerOrderTypes(): array
{
    return [
        \Author\Extension\OrderTypes\Delivery::class => [
            'code' => 'delivery',
            'name' => 'Delivery',
        ]
    ];
}
```

### Conditions

#### Defining conditions

Cart conditions are defined as classes that extends the `Igniter\Cart\CartCondition` class and implements the `apply` methods.

A cart condition class is typically stored in the `src/CartConditions` directory of your extension. Here's an example of a cart condition that applies a tip to the cart total:

```php
namespace Author\Extension\CartConditions;

use Igniter\Flame\Cart\CartCondition;

class Tip extends CartCondition
{
    public function beforeApply(): bool
    {
        
    }

    public function getActions(): array
    {
        
    }
}
```

The following methods are available to customize the cart condition:

- `beforeApply`: This method is called before the condition is applied to the cart. You can return `false` to prevent the condition from being applied.
- `afterApply`: This method is called after the condition is applied to the cart.
- `getRules`: This method returns the rules that must be met for the condition to be applied.
- `getActions`: This method returns the actions that will be applied to the cart. The actions can be `percentage`, `fixed`, or `value`.
- `whenValid`: This method is called when the condition is valid.
- `whenInvalid`: This method is called when the condition is invalid.

#### Registering conditions

Once you have defined a cart condition class, you need to register the cart conditions. Here's an example of registering a tip condition:

```php
public function registerCartConditions(): array
{
    return [
        \Author\Extension\CartConditions\Tip::class => [
            'name' => 'tip',
            'label' => 'Tip',
            'description' => 'Applies tips to cart total',
        ]
    ];
}
```

#### Using conditions

Cart conditions are automatically applied to the cart, however, you may apply metadata to a condition using the `loadCondition` method:

```php
use Igniter\Cart\Facades\Cart;

$condition = Cart::getCondition('tip');

$condition->setMetaData($metaData);

Cart::loadCondition($condition);
```

And check if a condition is applied successfully to the cart using the `isValid` method:

```php
if (Cart::getCondition('tip')->isValid()) {
    // Do something...
}
```

You can also clear the metadata on a condition using the `removeCondition` method:

```php
Cart::removeCondition('tip');
```

### Automation Events

For example, to send the order confirmation email to a customer:

```php
use Igniter\Cart\Models\Order;
use Igniter\Cart\Models\Stock;

$order = Order::find(1);

// Second parameter is a string or array of recipient type: customer, location or admin
$order->mailSend('igniter.cart::mail.order', 'customer');

// Send low stock alert email
